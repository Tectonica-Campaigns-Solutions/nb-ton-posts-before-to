Understanding the differences between U.S. and European digital organising is critical to building a winning movement. We explore the historical and present-day differences, looking specifically at 6 key areas in which digital organising differs between the two sides of the Atlantic.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">A Brief History on Organising from both sides of the Atlantic</h3>\n<p>Although U.S. American Saul Alinsky is generally considered to be the founder of modern community organising, the use of organising to advance people’s rights does not, in fact, have its roots in the U.S. In Europe during the industrial revolution, workers formed trade unions to advance their rights, including the right to organise and the right to a safe workplace. Both the U.S. and Europe have been able to improve their organising strategies by sharing lessons with each other on how to bring people together to achieve ambitious and democratic goals.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float: left; margin: 20px;\" src=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/tectonica/pages/1652/attachments/original/1566387376/Saul-Alinsky.jpg?1566387376\" alt=\"\" width=\"238\" height=\"285\"></p>\n<p>Similarly, while it seems the U.S. is often seen as a leader in digital organising, Europe has been doing really innovative work in digital that the U.S. could certainly learn from. We want to show you how digital organising has been deployed in various ways on both sides of the Atlantic, as understanding those nuances is core to making your movement a success in the global context.</p>\n</div>",
